# TODO

[x] random HSL color
[x] resizing items
[x] close button
[x] random location

---

[ ] Current sizes of items need to be saved
[ ] Adding video feature needs to be added
[ ] Saving the picture on the clipboard or added with the url as an item
[ ] Edit feature after adding items

probably i need to make a todo application first and continue this project with next.js. because I need to add a lot of features and starting all over will allow me to progress faster. (my opinion)
